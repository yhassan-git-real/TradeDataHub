# MainWindow File Organization

## Overview
All MainWindow-related files have been organized into a dedicated `MainWindow/` folder for better project structure and maintainability.

## File Structure

### MainWindow/ Directory
```
TradeDataHub/
├── MainWindow/
│   ├── MainWindow.xaml.cs                    (155 lines - Core window logic)
│   ├── MainWindow.MenuHandlers.cs            (123 lines - Menu event handlers)
│   ├── MainWindow.ButtonHandlers.cs          (31 lines - Button event handlers)
│   ├── MainWindow.ComboBoxHandlers.cs        (31 lines - ComboBox event handlers)
│   └── MainWindow.KeyboardHandlers.cs        (19 lines - Keyboard shortcuts)
├── MainWindow.xaml                           (Remains in root - required by WPF)
└── ... (other project files)
```

## Benefits of Organization

### 1. **Logical Grouping**
- All MainWindow partial classes are now in one dedicated location
- Clear separation from other project components
- Easier navigation and maintenance

### 2. **Improved Developer Experience**
- Faster file discovery when working on MainWindow features
- Reduced clutter in the root project directory
- Better IntelliSense organization in Solution Explorer

### 3. **Scalability**
- Easy to add new MainWindow partial classes as features grow
- Maintains clean project structure as codebase expands
- Follows standard .NET project organization patterns

## Technical Details

### Build Compatibility
- ✅ Build successful with no errors
- ✅ Application runs correctly with new file structure
- ✅ No project file modifications required (SDK-style auto-discovery)
- ✅ All partial class relationships maintained

### File Dependencies
- `MainWindow.xaml` remains in root (required by WPF conventions)
- All partial class files automatically discovered by .NET compiler
- Service dependencies (MenuService, KeyboardShortcutService) unaffected
- Resource file references maintained

## Migration Summary
Successfully moved 5 MainWindow partial class files from root directory to dedicated `MainWindow/` folder:
- Zero build errors
- Zero runtime issues
- Zero functionality changes
- Improved project organization achieved

*This organization complements the comprehensive 6-step refactoring that reduced MainWindow.xaml.cs from 534 lines to 359 lines across 5 modular partial classes.*

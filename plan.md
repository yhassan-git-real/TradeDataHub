Goal
Upgrade the TradeDataHub desktop UI to a modern, professional light-themed interface inspired by Microsoft and Google design standards, without changing- **HorizontalContentAlignment**: Set to "Stretch" for better content distribution across columns
- Build and runtime tests passed successfully, enhanced table displaying with modern professional appearance

**MAJOR LAYOUT FIXES & VISUAL IMPROVEMENTS:**
✅ **Fixed Grid Row Overlapping**: Resolved critical issue where Parameters Container and Mode Section were both using Grid.Row="2", causing Input Parameters to disappear completely
✅ **Added Visual Section Separators**: Implemented 3 horizontal separator lines for better visual organization:
   - Separator 1: Between Input Parameters Header and Container (Grid.Row="1")
   - Separator 2: Between Parameters Container and Mode Section (Grid.Row="3") - NEW
   - Separator 3: Between Mode Section and Activity Monitor (Grid.Row="5")
✅ **Optimized Separator Spacing**: Reduced margins from 20px to 10px (Margin="0,10") for cleaner, more compact appearance
✅ **Enhanced Separator Visibility**: Changed from light theme colors to #D1D5DB for better visual contrast
✅ **Removed Unwanted Headers**: Eliminated "Monitoring & Logs" header that was not in original design
✅ **Perfect Grid Structure**: Updated to 7-row Grid layout (0-6) with proper element positioning:
   - Row 0: Input Parameters Header
   - Row 1: First Separator
   - Row 2: Parameters Container (RESTORED)
   - Row 3: Second Separator (NEW)
   - Row 4: Mode Section
   - Row 5: Third Separator
   - Row 6: Activity Monitor
✅ **Input Parameters Restoration**: All form fields (From Month, To Month, HS Codes, Port Codes, Products, etc.) now visible and functional

- Build and runtime tests passed successfully with all layout issues resolved

Step 7 – Interaction Feedback & Micro-Animations
Add hover effects for interactive elements.

Smooth expand/collapse animation for Activity Monitor panel.

Fade-in effect for success/failure messages.

Test: Animations are smooth and don't affect performance.

Step 8 – Final Review & Cross-Version Testing
Verify UI scaling works at 100%, 125%, 150%.

Test on Windows system

Test: Full regression test to confirm no functional regressions.c, workflow, or functionality.

Step 1 – Create a Central Theme Dictionary ✅ COMPLETED
Add Themes/LightTheme.xaml to store:

✅ Fonts (Segoe UI, size tokens like 12pt, 14pt).

✅ Colors (primary accent blue, neutral grays, whites).

✅ Corner radius values.

✅ Spacing tokens (4px, 8px, 16px, 24px).

✅ Link it in App.xaml as a merged resource dictionary.

✅ Test: App still builds and runs with same functionality.

- Defined consistent spacing tokens from 2px to 24px
- Added corner radius tokens from 2px to 16px (pill)
- Added shadow effects (Small, Medium, Large)
- Successfully linked in App.xaml and build test passed

Step 2 – Standardize Typography ✅ COMPLETED
Apply font family Segoe UI (system default) and weight/size standards:

✅ Section headers: Bold, 16–18pt.

✅ Field labels: Medium, 12–14pt.

✅ Table text: Regular, 12pt.

✅ Move these into styles in LightTheme.xaml and apply globally.

- Maintained all existing visual hierarchy while standardizing typography
- Build test passed successfully

Step 3 – Layout Grid & Spacing Upgrade ✅ COMPLETED (FIXED - Mode Section)
Use Grid + UniformGrid for clean alignment of form fields (From Month, To Month, HS Codes) maintain consistent spacing, height, text box padding, height and alignment so the inside text will clear visable and add placeholder text.

✅ Ensure consistent padding/margins from spacing tokens.

✅ Group related inputs in Border or GroupBox with modern flat style.

✅ Test: Layout aligns perfectly and scales without breaking.
